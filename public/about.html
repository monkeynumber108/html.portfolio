<p>(1564â€“1616), English playwright. 
  His plays are written mostly in blank
   verse and include comedies, historical plays,
   the Greek and Roman plays, enigmatic comedies, 
   the great tragedies, and the group of tragicomedies
     with which he ended his career. He also wrote more than 
  150 sonnets, which were published in 1609, as well as narrative poems.</p>

<p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Admit impediments. Love is not love
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  Or bends with the remover to remove.
  O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  Within his bending sickle's compass come;
  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
  If this be error and upon me prov'd,
  I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.</p>
<hr>
<p>Double, double toil and trouble;
  Fire burn and caldron bubble.
  Fillet of a fenny snake,
  In the caldron boil and bake;
  Eye of newt and toe of frog,
  Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
  Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
  Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
  For a charm of powerful trouble,
  Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
  
  Double, double toil and trouble;
  Fire burn and caldron bubble.
  Cool it with a baboon's blood,
  Then the charm is firm and good.</p>
